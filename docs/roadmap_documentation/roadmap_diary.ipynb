    "\n",
    "#### Project Setup: Clean project import structure (load_raw_data() from src/data/), fresh imports.\n",
    "- Initial Data Exploration:\n",
    "- Loaded and previewed train.csv and store.csv.\n",
    "- Checked data types and null values.\n",
    "- Investigated StateHoliday column for mixed types and inconsistencies.\n",
    "- Checked Date range in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sales Distribution:\n",
    "- Plotted histogram of sales to look for distribution patterns.\n",
    "- Noticed the spike near zero sales values.\n",
    "- Zero-Sales Investigation:\n",
    "- Counted the number of sales = 0 and sales < 100 entries.\n",
    "- Replotted a cleaned histogram excluding zero sales to better understand \"real\" sales distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ‚úÖ Good commentary/annotations:\n",
    "- Added markdown cells explaining why each analysis step was important.\n",
    "- Wrote \"sanity checks\" notes about cleaning the StateHoliday column.\n",
    "- Wrote thoughtful exploration on potential issues in sales data (zero sales spike)."
