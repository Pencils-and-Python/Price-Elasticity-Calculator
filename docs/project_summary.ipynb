    "## 1. Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project focuses on the Rossmann Store Sales dataset, which contains historical sales data for 1,115 Rossmann drug stores. The goal is to forecast sales for these stores, helping Rossmann managers make better decisions regarding store budgets and staffing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key project objectives:\n",
    "- Predict daily sales for multiple Rossmann stores\n",
    "- Identify factors that influence sales performance\n",
    "- Develop a reliable forecasting model that accounts for various store attributes and temporal patterns\n",
    "- Provide actionable insights for store managers to optimize operations\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset includes information about promotions, competition, holidays, seasonality, and locality that"

    "## 2. Data Exploration Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Our exploratory data analysis revealed several important insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sales Patterns\n",
    "- **Temporal trends**: Sales exhibit strong day-of-week effects, with weekends (particularly Sundays) showing lower sales\n",
    "- **Seasonality**: Sales vary throughout the year, with increased activity during holiday seasons\n",
    "- **Store types**: Different store types show distinct sales patterns and average daily revenues\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Correlations\n",
    "- Positive correlation between store size and average sales\n",
    "- Promotional activities generally boost sales\n",
    "- Competition proximity impacts sales performance\n",
    "- Store locations in different states show varying sales patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "### Missing Data\n",
    "- Several columns contained missing values, including CompetitionDistance and some date-related fields\n",
    "- StateHoliday column required special handling due to its categorical nature\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outliers\n",
    "- Some stores show unusually high or low sales that required investigation\n",
    "- Promotional periods sometimes create sales spikes"

    "## 3. Data Cleaning Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Several data cleaning steps were implemented to prepare the dataset for analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "### StateHoliday Column Transformation\n",
    "1. Original encoding used '0' as string and 'a', 'b', 'c' for different holidays\n",
    "2. Converted to a proper categorical column\n",
    "3. Filled missing values with '0' (no holiday)\n",
    "4. Created dummy variables for modeling purposes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other Cleaning Operations\n",
    "- Handled missing values in CompetitionDistance by filling with median values\n",
    "- Converted date strings to datetime objects\n",
    "- Created additional time-based features (month, year, day of week)\n",
    "- Normalized numerical features to improve model performance\n",
    "- Removed duplicates and irrelevant columns\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Engineering\n",
    "- Created interaction features between promotions and holidays\n",
    "- Developed customer flow indicators\n",
    "- Extracted cyclical time features using sine/cosine transformations"

    "- The data was collected using the CLI download through kaggle.\n",
    "- The CSV files have over 1M rows, therefore, it was decided to use a database to access the clean code.\n",
    "- DuckDB was chosen to be used for this project due to its simplicity.\n",
    "- Python code was written in the src/data and src/database directories to establish the database files and connection.\n",
