    "# 📊 Understanding Elasticity\n",
    "\n",
    "Elasticity is one of those deceptively simple ideas that packs a ton of practical power. At its core, **elasticity measures how sensitive one thing is to changes in another thing.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we’re focused on **Price Elasticity of Demand (PED).**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💡 The Big Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "> **If you change the price of a product, how much will the quantity demanded by consumers change in response?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- If people **stop buying immediately** when the price goes up a little? That’s **elastic.**\n",
    "- If people **keep buying no matter what** (like medicine)? That’s **inelastic.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words: *How much do buyers care about the price?*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧮 The Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "The classic formula for PED is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "E_d = \\frac{\\%\\ \\text{Change in Quantity Demanded}}{\\%\\ \\text{Change in Price}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "If the price of a product goes **up 10%** and demand drops **20%**, then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "E_d = \\frac{-20\\%}{+10\\%} = -2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The **negative sign** is normal because price and demand usually move in opposite directions. Often, we focus on the *absolute value* when classifying elasticity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## 🚦 What the Numbers Mean\n",
    "\n",
    "| **Elasticity Value**            | **What It Means**                                   |\n",
    "|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| \\( E_d > 1 \\) (Elastic)          | Quantity demanded changes **more than** the price.  |\n",
    "| \\( E_d = 1 \\) (Unitary Elastic)  | Quantity changes by **exactly the same %** as price.|\n",
    "| \\( E_d < 1 \\) (Inelastic)        | Quantity changes **less than** the price.           |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Shortcut thinking:**\n",
    "- **Elastic:** Luxury goods, optional stuff.\n",
    "- **Inelastic:** Necessities, things you can’t easily substitute.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💰 Why It Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "The magic of elasticity is in **pricing strategy:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **If demand is elastic:** Raising prices = 🚫 bad idea → revenue *shrinks*.\n",
    "- **If demand is inelastic:** Raising prices = ✅ good idea → revenue *grows* (to a point).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is crucial for businesses, governments, and even civil infrastructure (like water rates!).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🌍 Real-World Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Elastic:**\n",
    "    - High-end electronics: If an iPhone jumps $500 in price, people *hesitate or switch.*\n",
    "    - Airline tickets: If one airline jacks up prices, you’ll check competitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inelastic:**\n",
    "    - Medicine: People will pay what they have to.\n",
    "    - Utilities: Basic services (water, electricity) that people *need.*\n",

    "## 🔧 In This Project\n",
    "\n",
    "This app is designed to let users **experiment interactively:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- *“What happens if I raise the price by 15%?”*\n",
    "- *“How much demand drop do I need to stay profitable?”*\n",
    "- *“Is my product in an elastic or inelastic zone?”*\n",
    "\n",
    "It transforms abstract math into **real-time decision-making power. 🚀**\n"
