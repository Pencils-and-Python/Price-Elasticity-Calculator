    "# 📈 Price Elasticity of Demand — A Data-Driven Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔍 Background\n",
    "\n",
    "In both economics and engineering applications, understanding how **demand responds to changes in price** is critical for decision-making. This concept is formally known as **price elasticity of demand**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elasticity is a core principle used in:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🛒 **Retail**: Optimizing prices to maximize revenue.\n",
    "- 🚗 **Transportation**: Estimating usage changes with toll adjustments.\n",
    "- ⚡ **Utilities**: Forecasting demand after rate hikes.\n",
    "- 🏗️ **Municipal Engineering**: Planning public resource allocation, such as water pricing or stormwater utility fees.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for price elasticity of demand is:\n",
    "\n",
    "%%\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Elasticity} = \\frac{\\%\\ \\text{change in quantity demanded}}{\\%\\ \\text{change in price}}\n",
    "%%\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation of elasticity values:\n",
    "- **Elastic** (|E| > 1): Quantity responds more than price.\n",
    "- **Inelastic** (|E| < 1): Quantity responds less than price.\n",
    "- **Unit Elastic** (|E| = 1): Quantity and price change proportionally.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Project Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Build a data-driven app that calculates and visualizes price elasticity of demand using real or synthetic data.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Users will:\n",
    "- Upload or select a dataset containing `price` and `quantity`.\n",
    "- Calculate elasticity across price intervals.\n",
    "- Visualize demand curves and highlight elasticity zones.\n",
    "- Experiment with \"what-if\" scenarios (e.g., simulate a 10% price change).\n",
